# OATS-One-At-a-Time-Security
This was the campus development project done by Designer's Consortium
#
PS:  To develop a biometric security system which can be installed in labs and office building to ensure high security and to prevent tailgating
#
Solution :
#
       Developed a system with 
  
       - RFID Authentication system (for high accuracy authentication)
       - Face Recognition and counting(for extra layer of protection and to prevent tailgating)
       - Fail-Secure locking system (to lock the gate even when there is no power)
       - Communication between all these sub parts
